# Rotate ctrl, super and alt

Custom remap ctrl to super, super to alt, alt to ctrl. This enables the usage
of the super key in keyboards without super, as long as this is used in
conjunction with a caps lock remap to ctrl.

## TODO

* utilize patches to apply custom changes
* alternatively directly patch xkeyboard-config or implement an easier route for
system-wide config changes in xkeyboard-config
